### Wet Code Markdown
These are the steps I took to make the code dry.
<ol>
  <li>I made two functions that process the transactions made on the saturday.</li>
  <li>There were many magic numbers floating around, I took them and factored them into an if loop.</li>
  <li>I reduced all of the repetitive code throughout the original coding.</li>
</ol>
