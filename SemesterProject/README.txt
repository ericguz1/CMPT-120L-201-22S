Snake Game Pygame - README

After you run the code of the game, a window should appear with the snake, food and the score.
You move the snake with the W A S D keys. 
The main objective of the game is to eat the food, while avoiding your snake body.
If you die, the snake length resets.
Since this is a highscore game, there is no game over, so to exit, hit the close window button.
